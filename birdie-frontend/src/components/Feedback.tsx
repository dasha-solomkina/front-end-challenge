        I got this board for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift. It is sturdy
        and solid with a feel that it’s well made. The lighting on the Plasma is
        what really excited her. The changing colors are very much to her taste.
        I was a bit nervous about the power of the twin 350 watt motors at
        first. She is eight years old and I thought that maybe this is too much
        for her. As usual, she proved me wrong. She had it mastered in two days
        and now she zips around like she’s been doing it all her life. She even
        rides it into the kitchen for a glass of milk. She rides a lot with her
        girlfriends who have hoverboards but she insists that hers is the
        coolest. I am very happy I made this purchase. I have bought other items
        for her (different companies, different items, that weren’t as
        satisfying as this.
