# Frontend Birdie Challenge

This project was created as part of the Birdie Frontend Challenge to demonstrate proficiency in frontend web development. The primary objective was to craft an intuitive and visually appealing user interface (UI) for efficiently managing customer feedback. With a focus on responsiveness, simplicity, and fluidity, the application ensures a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- **Feedback Management**: Easily view, search, and navigate through all customer feedback entries.
- **Tagging System**: Create and manage tags within specific feedback entries to facilitate efficient queries. Clicking on a tag filters feedback entries by that tag.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through feedback entries efficiently with pagination controls.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visual representation of feedback volume per month for better insights.
- **Figma Design Consistency**: The UI closely matches the provided Figma design.
- **Component-based Architecture**: The UI is modular, with pieces separated into individual components for better maintainability and reusability.
- **Type Safety**: Every component and data fetching function has well-defined types, enhancing developer experience and type safety.
- **Separated API Calls**: Every API call is in a separate file, eliminating API call logic from within components.
- **Tools**: React, TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, ECharts, and Figma.
